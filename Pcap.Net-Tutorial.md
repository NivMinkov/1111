## Pcap.Net tutorial: a step by step guide to using Pcap.Net
This section shows how to use the features of the Pcap.Net API. It is organized as a tutorial, subdivided into a set of lessons that will introduce the reader, in a step-by-step fashion, to program development using Pcap.Net, from the basic functions (obtaining the adapter list, starting a capture, etc.) to the most advanced ones (handling send queues and gathering statistics about network traffic).

Several code snippets, as well as simple but complete programs are provided as a reference.

The samples are written in plain C#, so a basic knowledge of C# programming is required. Also, since this is a tutorial about a library dealing with "raw" networking packets, good knowledge of networks and network protocols is assumed.

The tutorial is based on [WinPcap's tutorial](https://www.winpcap.org/docs/docs_412/html/group__wpcap__tut.html).
